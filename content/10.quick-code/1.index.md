## Takeaways

- zkSync is EVM compatible and you can write smart contracts in Solidity or Vyper.
- zkSync supports your favorite development toolkit Hardhat and Foundry.
- zkSync CLI provides a quick way to scaffold different types of projects thanks to its multiple templates.
- Contracts deployed to zkSync are compiled using `zksolc` or `zkvyper` as they generate a special bytecode for zkSync's ZKEVM.

## Next steps

This was your first step towards becoming a zkSync developer. Here is what you can do next:
